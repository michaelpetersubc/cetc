A social choice function (SCF) is said to be Nash implementable if there exists a mechanism in which every Nash equilibrium outcome coincides with that specified by the SCF. The main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of considering mixed strategy equilibria in Nash implementation. To do this, we focus on environments with two agents and restrict attention to finite mechanisms. We call a mixed strategy equilibrium compelling if its outcome Pareto dominates any pure strategy equilibrium outcome. We show that if the finite environment and the SCF to be implemented jointly satisfy what we call Condition P+M, we construct a finite mechanism which Nash implements the SCF in pure strategies and possesses no compelling mixed strategy equilibria. This means that the mechanism might possess mixed strategy equilibria which are not compelling. Our mechanism has several desirable features: transfers can be completely dispensable; only finite mechanisms are considered; integer games are not invoked; and agents' attitudes toward risk do not matter. These features make our result quite distinct from many other prior attempts to handle mixed strategy equilibria in the theory of implementation. We also illustrate the difficulty of extending our result to the case of more than two agents.

## The Economics of Career Concerns in Teamwork

[Huseyin Yildirim](https://works.bepress.com/huseyin_yildirim/) Duke University

This paper examines career incentives in teamwork by allowing complementarity between e¤ort and talent à la Dewatripont, Jewitt, and Tirole (1999, REStud): talent means little without hard work and vice versa. The first result identifies an incentive reversal: with e¤ort-talent complementarity, less well-known (higher prior-variance) team members work harder [resp. less hard] if the marginal cost of e¤ort is convex [resp. concave]. Next, itis shown that organizations can create high-performance teams by increasing transparency among peers or emphasizing their collective reputation. Peer transparency facilitates e¤ort coordination and leads the "market" to expect more from the team, whereas the emphasis on the collective reputation often motivates the less career-concerned members. It is further shown that team members with similar or correlated talents work harder, suggesting positive sorting of talent into different tasks. Last, the paper explores optimal disclosure (rating) of individual performance and determines when to provide team vs. competitive incentives to maximize effort.

## Blackwell Correlated Equilibrium

[Doron Ravid](https://sites.google.com/site/ravidd/) University of Chicago

We develop a method for making robust predictions in games with flexible information acquisition---i.e. rational inattention (Sims, 2003). In games with exogenous information, one can describe the set of attainable outcomes using Bergemann and Morris's (2016) Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). We introduce a refinement of BCE, Blackwell correlated equilibrium (BKE), and prove that it spans all outcomes attainable under some flexible learning technology whose costs increase in Blackwell's (1951, 1953) information order. We show the BKE set is either dense or nowhere dense in the BCE set, with the former being true for generic games. We conclude by exploring the implications of BKE on a Bertrand competition game, where we show the best BCE for consumers may not be approximable by BKEs.

We study the classic principal-agent model when the signal observed by the principal is chosen by the agent. We fully characterize the optimal information structure from an agent’s perspective in a general moral hazard setting. Unlike standard information design, only the support of the distribution of beliefs is relevant to the agent. We show that the problem can be mapped into a geometrical game between the principal and the agent in the space of likelihood ratios. We use this representation result to show that coarse contracts are sufficient: The agent can achieve her best with binary signals. Additionally, we characterize conditions under which the agent is able to extract all the surplus and implement the efficient allocation under full information. Finally, we show that when effort and performance are one-dimensional, under a general class of models, threshold signals are optimal.

We study a generalization of the classical monopoly insurance problem under adverse selection (see Stiglitz [1977]) where we allow for a random distribution of losses, possibly correlated with the agent’s risk parameter that is private information. Our model explains patterns of observed customer behavior and predicts insurance contracts most often observed in practice: these consist of menus of several deductible-premium pairs, or menus of insurance with coverage limits-premium pairs. The main departure from the classical insurance literature is obtained here by endowing the agents with risk-averse preferences that can be represented by a dual utility functional (Yaari [1987]).

## Reputation Effects under Short Memories

[Harry PEI](https://sites.northwestern.edu/harrypei/research/) Northwestern University

I study a novel reputation model in which a patient player interacts with a sequence of short-run players. Each short-run player can only observe the number of times that the patient player took each of his actions in the last K periods but not the exact sequence of these actions. When players' payoffs are monotone-supermodular, I show that the patient player can approximately secure his commitment payoff in all equilibria as long as K is at least one. I also show that the short-run players can approximately attain their highest feasible payoff in all equilibria if and only if K is lower than some cutoff. My proof uses a no-back-loop property, that it is never optimal for the patient player to first milk his reputation and later restore his reputation. I also introduce new techniques that can characterize the common properties of the patient player's behavior in all equilibria.

## A comprehensive revealed preference approach to approximate utility maximisation

[Pawel Karol Dziewulski](http://pawel-dziewulski.com)n Department of Economic, University of Sussex

We develop a comprehensive revealed preference method for studying preferences of individuals whose choices are inconsistent with utility maximisation. We assume that only the directly revealed strict preference relation reflects true preferences of the agent, while the weak one may be subject to imprecision, vagueness of judgement, or incommensurability. As a result, a natural consistency condition, acyclicity, is imposed on the former alone. We show that this restriction is necessary and sufficient for the data to be rationalisable with approximate utility maximisation, where an alternative is selected from a menu only if its utility is not significantly lower than that of any other available option. More importantly, although the individual may fail to maximise their utility exactly, it is possible to recover their true preferences from observations, make out-of-sample predictions and welfare comparisons. Our results require minimal assumptions on the empirical framework and are applicable, amongst others, to the study of choices over consumption bundles, state-contingent consumption, and lotteries.

## Non-Fundamental Volatility in Financial Markets

[Keisuke Teeple](http://keisuketeeple.wordpress.com) University of Waterloo

I use coarse Bayesian updating to explain three stylized facts: trading anomalies around major stock market milestones, excess price volatility and trade volume, and heavy-tailed prices. When expectations are coarse and traders are heterogeneous, traders make heterogeneous mistakes. This disagreement generates substantial trade volume and I show that the ensuing price discovery process converges in distribution to an empirically relevant class of Levy processes. Notably, I obtain this result without any exogenous shocks or processes; the only exogenous random variable is a heterogeneity parameter drawn at time zero. I then establish a perfectly non-revealing equilibrium: because traders are different, their aggregated trades generate volatile prices, yet this volatility impedes traders from learning their differences.

## Strategic Evidence Disclosure in Networks and Equilibrium Discrimination

[Leonie Baumann](https://sites.google.com/site/leoniebaumann/home) Department of Economics, McGill University

[Rohan Dutta](https://sites.google.com/site/rohandutta/) Department of Economics, McGill University</

A group of agents with ex-ante independent and identically uncertain quality compete for a prize, awarded by a principal. Agents may possess evidence about the quality of those they share a social connection with (neighbours), and themselves. In one equilibrium, adversarial disclosure of evidence leads the principal to statistically discriminate between agents based on their number of neighbours (degree). We identify parameter values for which an agent’s ex-ante winning probability is monotone in degree. All equilibria that satisfy some robustness criteria lie between this adversarial disclosure equilibrium and a less informative one that features no snitching and no discrimination.

## Everybody’s Talkin’ at Me: Levels of Majority Language Acquisition by Minority Language Speakers

Immigrants in economies with a dominant native language exhibit substantial heterogeneities in language acquisition of the majority language. We model partial equilibrium language acquisition as an equilibrium phenomenon. We consider an environment where heterogeneous agents from various minority groups choose whether to acquire a majority language fully, partially, or not at all. Different acquisition decisions confer different communicative benefits and incur different costs. We offer an equilibrium characterization of language acquisition strategies and find that partial acquisition can arise as an equilibrium behavior. We also show that a language equilibrium may exhibit insufficient learning relative to the social optimum. In addition, we provide a local stability analysis of steady state language equilibria. Finally, we discuss econometric implementation of the language acquisition model and establish identification conditions.

## Rational Inattention and Endogenous Volatility in Games: A Large Deviation Approach

[Tetsuya Hoshino](https://www.tetsuyahoshino.com) ITAM

[Takashi Ui](https://sites.google.com/site/takashiui/) Hitotsubashi University
			

Consider a game where rationally inattentive agents acquire costly information about exogenous fundamentals and endogenous aggregate actions.  In a finite-agent game, endogenous volatility arises because individual and aggregate actions are conditionally correlated given the fundamentals. We define a large-game equilibrium as the limit of equilibria of finite-agent games with information acquisition as the number of agents approaches infinity. Our main results are: (i) Every large-game equilibrium exhibits no endogenous volatility, meaning that agents eventually learn only about the fundamentals and not about aggregate actions; (ii) The rate of convergence is such that the probability of aggregate actions deviating from the equilibrium aggregate actions decays exponentially in the number of agents. These results allow us to evaluate how accurately we can approximate games where agents can learn about both fundamentals and aggregate behavior by more tractable ones where agents learn only about fundamentals. Our proof uses large deviation theory because the law of large numbers is inapplicable when actions are correlated.

## Comparative statics with adjustment costs and the le Chatelier principle

We develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for models with adjustment costs. We show that comparative statics conclusions may be drawn under the usual ordinal complementarity assumptions on the objective function, assuming very little about costs: only a mild monotonicity condition is required. We use this insight to provide a general treatment of the le Chatelier principle based on adjustment costs. We extend these results to<br />a fully dynamic model of adjustment over time: given only minimal<br />structure on costs, optimal adjustment follows a monotone path.  We apply our results to models of capital investment and of sticky prices.

## Strategy-proof Multi-Issue Mediation: An Application to Online Dispute Resolution

[Onur Kesten](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/onur-kesten.html) University of Sydney

Mediation (assisted negotiation) is the preferred alternative dispute resolution approach that has given rise to a multi-billion-dollar industry worldwide. Online dispute resolution providers rely heavily on mechanized e-Negotiation systems.  We develop a novel framework where two negotiators with diametrically opposed preferences seek resolution over a main issue and a supplementary issue. Negotiators are either rational, in the sense that all alternatives in the main issue are negotiable and all outcomes are acceptable, or have reference-dependent preferences, in the sense that some alternatives in the main issue are non-negotiable and some outcomes are deal-breakers (i.e., when compared to the outside option or the status quo). Types are private information and negotiators report their bargaining ranges (set of negotiable alternatives) over the main issue. The mediation process is represented by a mechanism with voluntary participation. We characterize the full class of strategy-proof, efficient, and individually rational mediation mechanisms. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such protocols is the so-called quid pro quo property; a weak condition that formulates preferences for compromise solutions.

## Competing to Commit: Markets with Rational Inattention

Two homogeneous-good firms compete for a consumer’s unitary demand. The consumer is rationally inattentive and pays entropy costs to process information about firms’ offers. Compared to a collusion benchmark, competition produces two effects. As in standard models, competition puts downward pressure on prices. But, additionally, an attention effect arises: Competition acts as a commitment device to keep market offers in check, allowing the consumer to engage in trade more often. For high enough attention costs, this attention effect dominates: Firms’ profits are higher under competition than under collusion. Our model can explain why markets with common ownership may remain competitive.

This paper presents arguments based on weak dominance and learning for se- lecting informative equilibria in a model of cheap-talk communication where play- ers must use monotonic strategies. Under a standard regularity condition, only one equilibrium survives iterated deletion of interim dominated strategies. Under the same condition, we establish that best-response dynamics converges to this outcome.

## How Informed Do You Want Your Principal To Be?

[Anne-Katrin Roesler](https://sites.google.com/site/akroesler/) Department of Economics, University of Toronto

In many bilateral trade settings of interest, at the time of contracting, both parties, i.e., the buyer and the seller,  have private information. However, most existing work restricts attention to one-sided private information to avoid the complications of an <em>informed principal</em> problem. Hence there is little understanding of the implications of two-sided private information on optimal mechanisms, and resulting seller profit and buyer welfare. Motivated by regulatory questions in the personalized pricing of products such as health insurance, we pose and answer the following question: how much (if any) private information would the buyer want the seller to have in a bilateral trade setting? <br />In our setting, the buyer's value for a good depends on his private type and the quality of the good that is unknown to him. The seller learns about the quality via a (noisy) private signal whose realization is the seller's private information. This quality affects both the buyer's value and the seller's cost, i.e., this is an interdependent values setting. We characterize the buyer-optimal outcome: this is the information structure and the corresponding seller-optimal equilibrium of the informed principal game that yields the highest consumer surplus. We show that there are conditions under which private information for the seller can lead both to greater profits and higher consumer surplus; that is, compared to being uninformed, seller private information can lead to Pareto gains. Additionally, maybe surprisingly, there are also conditions under which the seller does not benefit from having private information. These are settings where a privately informed seller leads to a lemons problem a la Akerlof (1970), albeit one where the information is two-dimensional (buyer and seller private information).   The information structure for the seller that yields the highest welfare for the buyer is typically not fully informative, i.e., the seller is only partially informed about the quality of the good. We interpret this as a justification for buyer privacy regulations.

We call a preference over menus an indirect preference if there exists a preference over the objects that make up the menus and a menu is ranked over another if it contains an object that is preferred to every object in the other menu. Suppose an observer has information on an agent’s ranking over some menus; we develop an empirically implementable test to determine if those rankings are part of an indirect preference. Our result has applications to (1) revealed price preference, (2) coarse rationalizability, (3) testing multiple preferences, and (4) testing minimax regret.

## Information Design in Cheap Talk

[Qianjun LYU](https://www.qianjunlyu.com) University of Bonn

[Wing Suen](https://www4.fbe.hku.hk/~wsuen/) University of Hong Kong

An uninformed sender publicly commits to an informative experiment about an uncertain state, privately observes its outcome, and sends a cheap-talk message to a receiver. We provide an algorithm valid for arbitrary state-dependent preferences that will determine the sender's optimal experiment and his equilibrium payoff under binary state space. We give sufficient conditions for information design to be valuable or not under different payoff structures. These conditions depend more on marginal incentives---how payoffs vary with the state---than on the alignment of sender's and receiver's rankings over actions within a state. The algorithm can be easily modified to study canonical cheap talk game with perfectly informed sender. 

## Who Controls the Agenda Controls the Polity

This paper models legislative decision-making with an agenda setter who can propose policies sequentially, tailoring each proposal to the status quo that prevails after prior votes. Voters are sophisticated and the agenda setter cannot commit to her future proposals. Nevertheless, the agenda setter obtains her favorite outcome in every equilibrium regardless of the initial default policy. Central to our results is a new condition on preferences, <em>manipulability</em>, that holds in rich policy spaces, including spatial settings and distribution problems. Our results overturn the conventional wisdom that voter sophistication alone constrains an agenda setter’s power.

## Collusion-proof dynamic mechanisms

[Heng Liu](http://hengliu.weebly.com) Department of Economics, University of Michigan

Most existing work in the dynamic mechanism design literature focuses on the truth-telling equilibrium in direct mechanisms. However, agents have plenty of opportunities to coordinate or collude in dynamic settings that could undermine the effectiveness of the mechanisms. This paper defines a notion of collusion-proofness and constructs efficient and collusion-proof direct dynamic mechanisms in independent private value environments with general transition dynamics. We also provide an indirect implementation of the collusion-proof mechanisms that generalizes the linking mechanism in Bayesian mechanism design without transfers.

## Endogenous Criteria for Success

[Rene Kirkegaard](http://www.renekirkegaard.com/) University of Guelph

Economic agents are motivated to undertake costly actions by the prospectof being rewarded for successes and punished for failures. But what determineswhat a success looks like? This paper endogenizes the criteria for success inan otherwise standard principal-agent model with risk neutrality and limitedliability. The set of feasible contracts is constrained by incentive constraintsand possibly by a budget constraint. If the principal manipulates the criteriafor success only to lower implementation costs, and depending on which type ofconstraint is more restrictive, the second-best action may be above or below thefirst-best action. However, given the second-best action, the criteria for successare as stringent as possible. In a class of problems where the principal's payoffdepends directly on the criteria for success, the second-best solution featureseither more stringent criteria for success or a lower action (or both) than thefirst-best solution.

## Procedural Expected Utility

[Mu Zhang](https://www.mu-zhang.com/) Department of Economics, University of Michigan


Individuals faced with multi-dimensional risk needs to complete two steps  in the decision-making process: aggregating deterministic outcomes and assessing risk in each dimension. The classical model, Expected Utility (EU), operates under the implicit assumption that outcome aggregation occurs before risk assessment. In this paper, we provide a new axiomatic framework to explore the various procedures used to finish these two steps in different orders. Our framework maintains the Independence axiom within each dimension but allows for relaxation of it cross dimensions, leading to novel procedures that reverse or partially reverse the order of EU. Through different applications, we demonstrate that our procedures can (i) explain experimental evidence of stochastic dominance violations without requiring individuals to choose less total money over more total money in the absence of risk, (ii) separate time and risk preferences without assuming a strong preference for early resolution of uncertainty, and (iii) accommodate non-trivial risk aversion over time lotteries without violating a notion of impatience under risk. 

## Pricing and Perpetual Royalties with Repeated Resale

[Matthew Mitchell](https://matthewmitchelltoronto.weebly.com/) Graduate Department of Management University of Toronto

This paper considers a durable object that is repeatedly resold among a potential buyers that trade bilaterally, so that markets are thin at any point in time. The results highlight differences between possible contracting environments which, in practice, have become especially important as record keeping technologies improve. Traditional ownership, where each owner sets a price unilaterally, leads to reduction in trade through markups; opportunities for future resale increase these inefficiencies relative to one time sales. Markups decline over time as resale opportunities decline. Fixed percentage perpetual royalties paid to the first owner, as mandated in some countries, are counterproductive; they lower the first owner's value. By constrast, a dynamic contract designed to maximize profits of the first owner achieves efficiency in all but the first sale, despite not achieving full surplus extraction at any point. The first sale is distorted exactly as a one time sale, which is a smaller distortion than any transaction under traditional ownership. The dynamic contract can be interpreted as nonlinear perpetual royalties, a form of payment that has increasingly been discussed especially in digital art markets as record keeping technologies improve. Such price discrimination can increase efficiency, especially in resale transactions.

## On Political Spectra

[Qinggong Wu](http://wqg.weebly.com/) Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

[Xingye Wu](http://wuxy.weebly.com/) Department of Economics, Tsinghua University

A political spectrum is a chart that places political opinions in a geometric space to illustrate their positions in relation to one another. We argue that its most essential feature is geometric representation of political disagreement: opinions which disagree more are positioned more separately in a spectrum. Building upon this insight, we formally define political spectra within a general social choice framework in which political opinions correspond to preferences. Specifically, we model a political spectrum as a mapping from preferences to a Euclidean space that geometrically represents dis- agreement in the preferences. We show that the model can accommodate a broad range of applications, and establish a number of existential and structural properties of political spectra thus modeled. We also find that a key parameter — the dimensionality of a spectrum — reflects the underlying ideological diversity within the society, and moreover, it is directly connected to the possibility for the society to elect a widely supported collective choice — the formal statement of this result subsumes findings in Grandmont (1978) and Nakamura (1979). 

## Rational Exuberance and Bubbles

[Yu Awaya](https://sites.google.com/site/yuawaya/home) Department of Economics, University of Rochester

[Vijay Krishna](https://sites.google.com/site/vjkrishna/) Department of Economics, Penn State University

We study a model of dynamic adverse selection in which a large group of sellers sell an asset of uncertain quality to a larger group of buyers. The quality is known to the sellers but unknown to the buyers. There is, however, the possibility that if the asset is of low quality, this will be revealed via public news at a random time. We show that there is a unique equilibrium satisfying forward induction. In this equilibrium a bubble develops. Even a worthless asset is traded at rapidly increasing prices. This is because in the absence of bad news, buyers become more and more optimisticó they exhibit rational exuberance.

## Marginal Stochastic Choice

[John Rehbeck](https://sites.google.com/site/johnrehbeck/) Ohio State University, Department of Economics</td>

Models of stochastic choice typically use conditional choice probabilities given menus as the primitive for analysis, but in the field these are often hard to observe. Moreover, studying preferences over menus is not possible with this data. We assume that an analyst can observe marginal frequencies of choice and availability, but not conditional choice frequencies, and study the testableimplications and identification of some prominent models of stochastic choice for this dataset. We also characterize the rationalizable marginal distributions in the models of Gul and Pesendorfer [2001] and of Kreps [1979], where agents select the menu before choosing an alternative.

## Common Agency with Non-Delegation or Imperfect Commitment

[Siyang Xiong](https://sites.google.com/site/xiongecon/) Department of Economics, University of California, Riverside

Inspired by Szentes critique (Szentes (2009)), we study common agency models with non-delegated contracts. In such a setup, we prove that the menu theorem in Peters (2001) holds partially only under some particular information structure, and we use examples to show that it fails generally. Furthermore, we prove a menu-of-menu-<br />with-recommendation theorem in our models. Finally, we show that our results can be easily extended to common agency with imperfect commitment &agrave; la Bester and Strausz (2000, 2001, 2007).

## Randomization and Linearity in the Robust Principal-Agent Problem

We study a contracting problem between a principal and an agent, both of whom are protected by limited liability. The principal knows a surplus-generating action the agent can take, but is concerned that others may be available. Hence, she chooses a contract to maximize her worst-case payoff over all possible unknown actions. Carroll (2015) showed that the optimal deterministic contract in this setting is linear, but Kambhampati (2023) showed that randomization strictly benefits the principal, leaving open the question of the structure of the optimal (random) contract. We prove a positive result: For any random contract, there exists a randomization over linear contracts that does at least as well.
